# Publications — Coming Soon

I am currently in the early stages of my research career, and while I do not yet have formally published papers listed here, I have been actively involved in academic and applied research across both undergraduate and graduate studies.

During my undergraduate degree, I worked on research focused on cognitive health and Alzheimer's disease, applying machine learning techniques to speech and related signals. That work has undergone multiple iterations and refinements and is actively being prepared for publication. Because it is still in progress, it is not listed as a finalized publication yet.

In parallel, I gained valuable applied research experience as a software developer intern within Autodesk's research division, where I worked on data-driven and machine-learning-powered systems in a real-world research setting. While this work did not result in an academic publication, it significantly shaped my research and engineering skill set.

I am now continuing my research at the graduate level in the Master of Applied Computing program, where I am working on a preliminary results paper as part of my master's research. This work is currently in the submission and review preparation stage, and publications will be added here as they become publicly available.

If you would like more details about my research background, technical focus, and hands-on experience, you can download my resume from the top-right corner of this website, where each of these research roles is described in more depth.

Publications will be added to this section as they are finalized and published.
