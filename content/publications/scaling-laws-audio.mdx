## Abstract

We investigate the scaling behavior of neural audio synthesis models across different architectures and datasets. Our findings suggest that model performance scales predictably with compute and data size.

<Metric label="Dataset Size" value="10k Hours" description="High-quality audio samples" />
<Metric label="Compute" value="128 A100s" description="Total training resources" />

## Methodology

We trained several model variants ranging from 10M to 1B parameters...
