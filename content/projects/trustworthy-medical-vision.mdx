# Trustworthy Medical Vision

**Status: Project Plan & Active Development** — This page outlines the technical roadmap for an upcoming medical image classification project focused on explainability, uncertainty estimation, and explanation reliability analysis. I will update this page as the project progresses through its milestones.

## TL;DR

- **Explainable medical image classifier** using pretrained CNN backbone (ResNet/EfficientNet) with visual explanations (Grad-CAM + Score-CAM)
- **Uncertainty estimation** via MC Dropout and/or Deep Ensembles with calibration analysis (ECE, Brier, reliability diagrams)
- **Explanation reliability analysis** measuring stability under perturbations and correlation with uncertainty/correctness
- **Evaluation-first methodology** with fixed benchmark, deterministic splits, and rigorous failure case auditing
- **Responsible AI framing** with explicit limitations, disclaimers, and trust failure mode analysis

## Project Overview

This project builds a medical image classification system that treats **confidence** and **explanations** as first-class outputs alongside predictions. The technical contribution is not "beating SOTA," but demonstrating **responsible ML research** and **production-minded ML engineering** by analyzing when the model should be trusted and when it should not.

**Core idea:** In healthcare-relevant ML, a model's accuracy can look strong while its **confidence is miscalibrated** and its **explanations are unstable**. This project treats explanations as **objects of measurement**, not just visuals.

---

## Motivation

Medical decision support requires trust, interpretability, and explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty. Pure classification performance is insufficient because errors can be high-impact, data shifts are common, and explanations can be visually convincing yet wrong.

### What This Project Demonstrates

**ML/Research Discipline**
- Transfer learning with pretrained CNNs and disciplined experimental design
- Explainability engineering with Grad-CAM/Score-CAM implementation
- Uncertainty estimation (MC Dropout/Deep Ensembles) with calibration metrics
- Evaluation beyond accuracy: reliability diagrams, ECE, Brier, selective prediction
- Explanation reliability analysis: stability metrics and failure case audits

**ML Engineering**
- Reproducible, config-driven pipelines with tracked artifacts
- Deterministic data splits with patient-level separation
- CLI-driven workflow for training, inference, and evaluation

### What This Project Does NOT Claim

- Clinical readiness, diagnostic capability, or deployment in real care
- Fairness across all demographics unless dataset supports it
- Explanations as "ground truth" — they are assessed as signals with limitations

---

## Planned Architecture

The system follows an evaluation-first pipeline where trust analysis is as important as prediction performance.

## Technical Scope

### In Scope
- Binary medical image classification task
- Pretrained CNN backbone (ResNet50 / EfficientNet-B0/B1)
- Visual explanations: Grad-CAM + Score-CAM
- Uncertainty: MC Dropout and/or Deep Ensembles
- Reliability analysis: calibration + explanation stability + trust failure cases

### Out of Scope
- Large-scale training from scratch
- Clinical validation or deployment
- Extensive hyperparameter sweeps

### Target Dataset
CheXpert or NIH ChestXray14 for binary classification (e.g., "Pneumonia vs No Pneumonia").

---

## Evaluation Methodology

### Predictive Performance
- AUROC (primary), Accuracy, F1 / Precision-Recall

### Calibration & Uncertainty
- ECE, Brier score, Reliability diagrams, Selective prediction curves

### Trust-Focused Analysis
Create "trust quadrants" for systematic analysis:
- **Correct + confident + stable explanation** (ideal)
- **Correct + uncertain** (appropriate caution)
- **Incorrect + confident** (danger zone)
- **Incorrect + uncertain** (less dangerous)

### Explanation Stability
Explanations generated under perturbations (MC Dropout runs, test-time augmentation) with stability metrics: heatmap overlap, rank correlation, center-of-mass shift.

## Planned Deliverables

- Config-driven training/inference/explain/eval
- Checkpointed baseline + uncertainty-enabled variant
- Calibration evaluation + selective prediction
- Explanation generation (2 methods)
- Explanation stability analysis with metrics
- Failure case audit with curated examples
- Responsible AI docs + disclaimers
- Clean README + architecture diagram + example outputs

## Responsible AI & Safety

### Required Disclaimers
- Research/educational decision-support only
- Not a medical device or for diagnosis

### Ethical Considerations
- Dataset bias, label noise, missing demographic metadata
- Domain shift risks and confounders

### Limitations
- No external validation
- Explanations are not ground truth
- Calibration and stability are dataset-dependent
