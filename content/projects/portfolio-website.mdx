# Personal Portfolio Website

## Overview
This project is the foundation of my personal site: projects, blog posts, and publications in a clean, fast UI. The priorities are maintainability, a great writing flow, and performance.

## Problem
I wanted a site that’s easy to update, fast to load, and pleasant to maintain — without a complex CMS or heavyweight tooling.

## Approach
- Next.js 16 (App Router) for routing and server-side rendering
- Tailwind CSS 4 for composable, design‑system‑friendly styles
- MDX + `gray-matter` so content is simple files with frontmatter
- Reusable components for cards, sections, and MDX rendering

## Result
The first version is live with Projects, Blog, and Publications. Content is file‑based, builds are fast, and the UI is straightforward to extend.

## Decisions and trade‑offs
- File‑based content over CMS: better diffs and local iteration
- App Router for modern Next.js patterns and layout control
- Minimal dependencies to keep bundle size small

## Architecture
Content files live under `content/` and are loaded via helpers in `lib/content.ts`. Pages in the App Router render MDX with custom components for consistent typography and layout.

## Performance notes
Using the App Router and lean components keeps client payloads small. Static content routes are cached aggressively; images and assets can be optimized as needed.

## Roadmap
- More detailed case studies and embedded demos
- Richer MDX components (callouts, code blocks, diagrams)
- SEO and Open Graph polish
- Accessibility and keyboard navigation improvements

## Status
Work in progress — I’ll keep shipping small improvements and write-ups as I go.
