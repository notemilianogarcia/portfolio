# Personal Portfolio Website

A statically-generated portfolio website built to showcase ML engineering work, publications, and blog posts with fast load times and straightforward content management.

## Overview

This site serves as a centralized platform for projects, publications, professional experience, and technical writing. The design prioritizes clarity, performance, and maintainability over visual complexity. Content is authored in MDX files with YAML frontmatter, rendered at build time, and served statically. This is a custom-built system optimized for engineering portfolios, not a modified template.

## What I Built

**Site Architecture**

The application uses Next.js 16 App Router with React 19 Server Components for efficient code splitting and static generation. All content pages are pre-rendered at build time, eliminating runtime content fetching. The root layout handles font loading (Sora, Inter, JetBrains Mono), theme provider setup, and global metadata.

**Content System**

Content lives in version-controlled MDX files organized by type (blog, projects, publications). Each file includes YAML frontmatter for metadata (title, date, tags, featured status) parsed via gray-matter. A content loading utility (`lib/content.ts`) reads files, extracts frontmatter, and sorts by date. MDX is rendered server-side using `next-mdx-remote` with custom component mappings for callouts, figures, and metrics.

**Component Library**

Reusable components handle all interactive elements: project cards with split click zones (title navigates, tags remain selectable), expandable tag groups with color categorization (ML orange, backend blue, language green), publication cards with abstract toggles, and an email contact component with clipboard copy. Components follow a consistent depth-based shadow system and share theme tokens via CSS custom properties.

**Tag System**

Tags are categorized by type (ML, backend, language, database, frontend, ops) and assigned IDE-inspired colors for quick visual scanning. On cards, tags are grouped by category with a +N overflow button to prevent layout breaking. Tags are ordered by recruiter importance rather than alphabetically.

**Theming**

All colors are defined as CSS custom properties in `globals.css` and toggled via a `data-theme` attribute on the root element. The theme provider manages state and persists preferences. This approach provides fine-grained control over tokens without Tailwind's theme configuration complexity.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16.1.0**: App Router for modern routing patterns, static generation for zero-latency content serving, Turbopack for fast development builds
- **TypeScript 5**: Strict mode enabled for type safety across components and content utilities
- **Tailwind CSS 4**: Utility-first styling with custom CSS properties for theme tokens
- **MDX + next-mdx-remote 5.0.0**: File-based content authoring with component composition and server-side rendering
- **React 19.2.3**: Server Components reduce client JavaScript, improving initial load performance

## Engineering & Design Decisions

- **File-based content over CMS**: Content versioned with git, no API latency, simple local editing, readable diffs
- **Static generation over SSR**: All content pages pre-rendered at build time for consistent fast loads and CDN-friendly caching
- **CSS custom properties over Tailwind themes**: Single `data-theme` attribute flip toggles entire color system without JavaScript
- **Split card interactions**: Card titles link to detail pages, tag areas remain non-interactive for text selection and copying
- **Tag color categorization**: Recruiters scan quickly; color grouping surfaces relevant skills (ML, backend, frontend) without reading every tag
- **Minimal dependencies**: Radix UI for accessible primitives, Lucide for icons, no heavy frameworks or UI libraries

## Development & Deployment

Development runs locally via `npm run dev` with Turbopack for fast refresh. The production build (`npm run build`) generates static HTML and optimized assets. The site is configured for deployment to Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting with automatic builds on git push. No environment variables or runtime configuration required.
