# Where Are My Publications? A Look Into My Research Journey

You might have landed on my portfolio, clicked on the Publications section, and wondered why it's still marked as "coming soon." That's a fair question — and this post is here to give you a clearer picture of what I've been working on, what I care about as a researcher, and where I'm headed next.

I'm early in my research career, but I've been actively involved in research for several years now, both in academia and industry. My path hasn't been about rushing papers out the door — it's been about learning how to do research properly, building strong technical foundations, and working on problems that genuinely interest me.

## My research background

My research journey started during my undergraduate studies, where I worked on projects related to cognitive health and Alzheimer's disease. That work involved applying machine learning to speech and related data, experimenting with different modeling approaches, and learning how to design experiments, analyze results, and communicate findings clearly. That project has gone through multiple revisions and extensions over time and is currently being prepared for publication, which is why it doesn't yet appear as a finalized paper.

Alongside academic research, I've also spent time in industry research. During my internship at Autodesk, I worked within the research division on data-driven and machine-learning-powered systems aimed at solving real-world problems. While that work did not lead to an academic publication, it gave me invaluable experience in applied research: designing robust pipelines, working with messy real data, collaborating with researchers and engineers, and translating ideas into usable systems.

## What I'm working on now

I'm currently continuing my research as part of my Master of Applied Computing, where I'm working on a research project that builds on my earlier interests in machine learning, multimodal data, and systematic experimentation. I'm in the process of preparing a preliminary results paper, with the goal of publishing and expanding this work as part of my graduate research.

At this stage, much of my effort goes into designing clean experimental setups, testing ideas rigorously, understanding model behavior, and learning how to balance performance, robustness, and interpretability. Publishing is absolutely a goal — but as anyone who's been through the process knows, it takes time, iteration, and careful validation.

## What I care about as a researcher

Broadly, I'm interested in applied machine learning problems where real-world constraints matter. I enjoy working with speech and text data, building end-to-end experimentation pipelines, and exploring models that are not just accurate, but also efficient, stable, and easier to reason about.

I'm particularly drawn to:

- Multimodal learning (combining different types of signals)
- Thoughtful experiment design and benchmarking
- Understanding why models behave the way they do
- Bridging research ideas with practical engineering

A lot of what I've learned so far hasn't come from finished papers, but from the process itself: failed experiments, unexpected results, refactoring pipelines, rethinking assumptions, and slowly getting better at asking the right questions.

## So… where are the publications?

They're coming — and when they're ready, they'll live on the publications page. For now, the publications section reflects where I am: actively researching, writing, revising, and learning how to do high-quality work that I'm proud to put my name on.

If you'd like a more detailed view of my research experience, technical background, and the projects I've worked on, you can download my resume from the top-right corner of this website. It outlines my academic roles, industry research experience, and the skills I've developed along the way.
