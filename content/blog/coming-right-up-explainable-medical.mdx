# Coming Right Up: Explainable Medical Vision

I've been working on a new project that bridges my research interests in trustworthy machine learning with practical application in healthcare. It's called **Trustworthy Medical Vision**, and it's a medical image classification system designed from the ground up with explainability and uncertainty estimation as first-class concerns.

## What I'm Building

The project focuses on building a CNN-based classifier for medical images that doesn't just predict — it explains *why* it makes predictions and quantifies *how confident* it is. This isn't about achieving state-of-the-art accuracy; it's about demonstrating responsible ML engineering in a high-stakes domain.

Key components include:
- **Grad-CAM and Score-CAM** for visual explanations of model decisions
- **Monte Carlo Dropout** for uncertainty quantification
- **Stability analysis** to measure how explanations change under perturbations
- **Trust quadrant analysis** to identify when the model should and shouldn't be trusted

## Connecting to My Research Work

This project directly builds on my ongoing research in explainable AI and model interpretability. My graduate research has focused on understanding why deep learning models behave the way they do, particularly in multimodal settings. The Trustworthy Medical Vision project takes those research insights and applies them to a concrete, production-minded implementation.

It's also an opportunity to showcase the full ML engineering lifecycle: from experimental design and reproducible pipelines to evaluation metrics that go beyond simple accuracy. In healthcare applications, knowing *when* a model is reliable versus when it might be misleading is just as important as knowing *what* it predicts.

## Why This Matters

Medical AI systems need to be trustworthy, especially when they're used to inform clinical decisions. A model that can say "I'm 95% confident this is pneumonia, and here's why" is more useful than one that just says "pneumonia" with no explanation or uncertainty quantification.

The project serves as both a technical demonstration and a portfolio piece, showing how research insights translate into practical, responsible ML systems. I'm currently in the early implementation phases, setting up the evaluation framework and baseline models.

Stay tuned for updates as the project progresses — I'll be sharing insights on explainability techniques, uncertainty estimation, and the challenges of building trustworthy medical AI systems.
