# Welcome — starting this personal space

Thanks for stopping by! I’m building this site as a lightweight, evolving home for my work and ideas across machine learning, audio, and systems. It’s intentionally simple right now and will keep improving over time — consider it a living notebook and portfolio rather than a finished product.

## What you’ll find

- Projects: concise case studies highlighting the problem, approach, and result
- Blog: shorter posts, design notes, and experiments
- Publications: links and summaries for papers and related write‑ups

## Why this stack

I’m using Next.js (App Router) with Tailwind CSS and MDX. Content lives in files under `content/` and is parsed via simple helpers — no heavy CMS, easy diffs, fast iteration.

## What to expect (work in progress)

I’ll ship small updates regularly:

- New project write-ups and interactive demos
- Iterations on component design and content tooling
- Occasional deep dives into research directions

If something looks off or you have feedback, I’d love to hear it. Thanks for reading — and welcome!
