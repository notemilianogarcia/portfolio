# About Me

Hi — I'm Emiliano.

I'm a **machine learning researcher and engineer** who enjoys working where theory meets practice, especially on problems that demand both technical rigor and real-world awareness. I'm currently completing my **Master's in Applied Computing**, where my work focuses on applied ML research, multimodal learning, and building experimental pipelines that are not only performant, but also **reliable and interpretable**.

## My research journey

My research journey started earlier than most. During my undergraduate studies, I became deeply interested in how signals like speech, language, and behavior can reveal subtle cognitive and neurological patterns. That curiosity led me into applied research spanning **speech analysis, audio processing, representation learning, and multimodal modeling**—often in low-data, high-noise settings where careful experimentation matters more than flashy architectures.

Over time, I've grown particularly interested in **designing efficient learning systems**, understanding why models behave the way they do, and stress-testing them beyond headline metrics. I enjoy running ablations, probing failure modes, and asking uncomfortable but necessary questions like: *Does this generalize? Can we trust it? What is the model actually learning?*

Alongside research, I've worked in industry environments where ML had to translate into something usable. Those experiences shaped how I think about engineering: **clean pipelines, reproducibility, and communication matter just as much as accuracy**. I like being involved across the full loop—from data and modeling decisions to evaluation, documentation, and explaining results to different audiences.

## What I care about

On a more personal note, I'll admit something: I've never been great at showcasing my own work. I tend to move fast, learn a lot, and then move on—sometimes before a project feels "perfect enough" to share. **This site is my way of changing that mindset.**

What you'll find here is not an exhaustive archive of everything I've done. Instead, it's a **curated snapshot**: selected research directions, representative projects, and experiments that reflect how I think, how I build, and what I'm excited about. Some pieces are polished; others are exploratory by design. All of them are intentional.

Outside of the technical details, I care deeply about being a **good collaborator**. I'm calm under pressure, honest about uncertainty, and genuinely enjoy helping others reason through complex problems. I take my work seriously, but I leave room for curiosity, humility, and the occasional dry joke—used responsibly.

If this gives you a clearer sense of who I am and how I approach problems, then it's doing its job.
