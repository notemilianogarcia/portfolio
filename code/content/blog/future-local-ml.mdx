# About Me

Hello! I am Emiliano.

I'm a machine learning researcher and engineer who is very interested in creating things that actually work in the real world. I'm currently doing my Master's degree in Applied Computing, where my research is at the intersection of applied machine learning research and practical, low-data speech-based systems for early Alzheimer's disease detection. Most of my experience is in that space between theory and practice: designing models, conducting experiments, implementing ideas to make them robust, interpretable, and useful.

First of all, I'm more than my stack.

I grew up learning to balance curiosity with responsibility from a pretty young age, including school, work, research, teaching, side projects all at once. This has informed how I approach work now: I'm responsible, thoughtful, and a total owner. I'm interested in doing things right when nobody's around to notice, and I try to be a type of colleague that people can count on when things get complicated.

## Professionally

My background involves applied research in machine learning, multimodal learning (speech, text, etc.), and end-to-end experiment pipelines. I have applied my skills in academic as well as industry environments, including research roles that required rigorous thinking to produce something that was useful. I enjoy asking "why did this work?" just as much as "how do we make this better?"

If I'm being honest, one of my long-standing weaknesses has been visibility. I have always been a quick learner but slow to share. Most of the projects that I have worked on have taught me a lot but never progressed beyond the "good learning experience" stage because I went on to the next thing before completing the narrative. That's why this website exists.

What you'll find here is not everything I've ever worked on. That would be overwhelming, and I've worked on a lot of things. What you'll find here is a few research projects, selected experiments, and representative work that shows how I think, how I build, and what I'm capable of. Some of it is in-depth, and some of it is more of a showcase.

## Outside of Work

Outside of the working world, I'm easy to work with, calm under pressure, and love helping others succeed. While my work is important, I don't take myself too seriously, always leaving time for a bit of curiosity, humility, and an occasional bad joke (in moderation, of course!).

If this gives you a sense of how I think and work, then it's doing its job.

Welcome and thank you for taking the time.
